    "Tests are run for various values of $n:(10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000)$ (see code below). The differences with the summation found with the double-precision method of exercise a and the other methods are for small $n$ (less than 100) approximately the same, however, the compenated summation algorithm already manages to perform slightly more accurate that the other algorithms. Moreover, for a greater values of $n$ we note more significant effect:\n",
    "* The summation algorithm of exercise c (the compensted summation algrotihm) is in all cases the most accurate (similar to the summation of exercise a). It is even insensitive to the order of summation (given, increasing or decreasing) and always yields the same result. This is not the case for the basic summation algorithm. For the basic summation algorithm it seems most accurate to perform the summation with an increasing order of numbers. The summation performed with the given order is more accurate than the algorithm with decreasing magnitude. So the complete rank would be: (1) the compensated summation algorithm (exercise c, given/increasing/decreasing order); (2) basic summation algorithm (increasing order); (3) basic summation algorithm (given order); and finally (4) basic summation algorithm (decreasing order).\n",
    "* The compensated summation algorithm is the most time consuming of all. This makes sense as it contains the most elmentary operations of all. Furthermore, we note that the basic summation in increasing order is slower than performing the summation in decreasing order which in turn is slower than the basic summation in given order (might be to the fact that we need to sort the floating point numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm in part (c) works because it makes use of two different accumulators: total holds the sum and c accumulates the part not assimilated into total, to nudge the low-order part of total the next time around. Thus the summation proceeds with \"guard digits\" in c, which is better than not having any, but is not as good as performing the calculations with double the precision of the input."
