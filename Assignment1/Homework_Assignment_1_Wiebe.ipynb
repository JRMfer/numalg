    "In other words, how much data error in the initial input would be required to explain all of the error in the ﬁnal computed result? More formally, the quantity ∆x = ˆ x−x,where f(ˆ x) = ˆ y, is called the backward error, whose relative magnitude we try to estimate in backward error analysis. From this perspective, an approximate solution to a given problem is good if it is the exact solution to a “nearby” problem (i.e., the relative backward error is small). Indeed, if the nearby problem is within the uncertainty in the input data, then the computed solution ˆ y might actually be the “true” solution for all we know (or can know, given the uncertainty in the input), and therefore can hardly be faulted.\n",
